                        As the year comes to an end and a new calendar begins,
                        ‘tis the season for celebration but it’s not all parties
                        and good times. Here are some ways to cope.
                     </p>

                     <p>Plan, Plan, Plan</p>
                     <p>
                        It’s so easy to get overwhelmed with everything that’s
                        going on and it feels like nothing is within your
                        control. The key is to have a structure in place ahead
                        of time, where you plot things in and allocate time for
                        each. That gives you an overview of what’s to come and
                        you can then plan out your schedule. Besides family
                        commitments and social activities, remember to also
                        carve out time for yourself – some “me” time away from
                        everyone, a workout session, a day at the spa, a walk in
                        nature …
                     </p>
                     <p>Top tip</p>
                     <p>
                        You can’t do everything and be everywhere all at once,
                        so choose sensibly. Define your priorities and put those
                        in your plan first. Everything else is optional.
                     </p>
                     <p>Set Routines And Rules</p>
                     <p>
                        Things like nutrition and fitness are prone to get
                        sidelined as rich foods will be in abundance and
                        someone’s always ready to offer you a glass. You don’t
                        want to hold yourself back to the point that you miss
                        out on the merriment, but you also don’t want the guilt
                        and other repercussions afterwards. This is what you can
                        do: For one to two weeks prior, go on a clean eating
                        spree. Be diligent with your workouts. In short, get
                        your health in the best shape possible so your body can
                        cope better with the indulgences. That doesn’t mean you
                        should then go all out and let everything go down the
                        drain once the festivities begin though. Set your
                        limitations and allowances e.g. fill at least half your
                        plate with vegetables and fruits at every meal, no more
                        than x number of drinks per night, one dessert per day.
                     </p>

                     <p>Top tip</p>
                     <p>
                        Start each day with a short, simple workout. You’ll feel
                        better the rest of the day and reap the many benefits of
                        morning workouts.
                     </p>

                     <p>Define Your Boundaries</p>
                     <p>
                        No, just no, and that’s perfectly ok. Whether it’s due
                        to peer pressure, not wanting to be a killjoy or the
                        need to please, we often find it hard to turn people and
                        requests down. You want to make everyone happy – but
                        what about you? Are you happier doing it or not doing
                        it? Know your limits, respect yourself and your needs.
                        If someone tells you they are not comfortable with
                        something, would you still push them towards it or step
                        back and give them space? Do the same for yourself.
                     </p>
                     <p>Top tip</p>
                     <p>
                        It could take a while to get the hang of things so you
                        might find yourself getting off track in the beginning,
                        but practice makes perfect. Keep at it and it will get
                        easier.
                     </p>

                     <p>Reach Out</p>
                     <p>
                        Whether you feel overwhelmed by too many things going on
                        or are lonely from not being able to be with your loved
                        ones, you don’t have to face it all by yourself. You are
                        never alone because there are others going through the
                        same holiday stress. Connect with family and friends any
                        which way you can. If it’s not possible to meet in
                        person, get on a video call, do the old-fashioned way
                        with a phone call, or exchange text messages. There are
                        many, many ways to reach out, and people appreciate it
                        when you take the initiative to do so.
                     </p>

                        Connections don’t always have to happen in real time.
                        “Slow” methods like snail mail has become rare but
                        that’s all the more reason to bring it back. A
                        handwritten note, a card in an envelope … there is as
                        much joy in giving as in receiving.
                     </p>
                     <p>In And Out</p>
                     <p>
                        There is an easy technique to cope with anxiety and it’s
                        something that you already know how to do: breathing.
                        Question is, are you doing it the right way so as to
                        calm your nerves or the opposite? Quick, shallow chest
                        breathing can cause the heart to beat faster, muscle
                        tension and dizziness. In short, it can trigger a stress
                        response. On the other hand, deep and slow breathing
                        tells the nervous system that everything is ok. That
                        helps regulate things like digestion and blood flow.
                        When it feels like things are falling apart, find a
                        quiet corner and try some of these breathing exercises.
                     </p>
                     <p>Top tip</p>
                     <p>
                        You don’t have to wait for those anxious feelings to
                        arise before launching into deep breathing mode. Just do
                        several rounds of the exercises whenever you remember
                        and it will become second nature.

                        everything else.
